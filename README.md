### 🔬 The field has tolerated unreliable autoresearch long enough — Anti-Autoresearch is the read that finally catches it.

***天下苦 autoresearch 久矣 —— Anti-Autoresearch 替研究者们一眼看穿不靠谱的工作。***

</div>

> 🏆 **Built on a battle-tested foundation: [ARIS](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep)** (~12.5k★ · HuggingFace Daily Papers #1 · 78+ skills across 7+ platforms). Anti-Autoresearch points ARIS's production audit DNA (experiment-audit · paper-claim-audit · citation-audit · kill-argument) **outward** — auditing a third party's submission instead of your own.

Autoresearch has gone mainstream, and a fast-growing share of what reaches the review
pile is machine-generated — and a lot of it **doesn't hold up**: tables that don't
match the text, baselines that aren't there, open-sourced code that won't reproduce
its own paper. Reviewers, area chairs, and honest authors increasingly need to
**verify** that, not just suspect it.

> Regardless of *who or what* wrote a paper, does the science hold together and
> reflect its own evidence? Anti-Autoresearch audits a submission for
> **self-consistency** and **fabrication**, and produces a span-anchored,
> reviewer-ready report. It is **not** an *opaque* AI-text classifier (no authorship
> probabilities, no "AI-written" verdict) and does **not** judge misconduct — it surfaces
> discrepancies a human reviewer should investigate. Separately, it lists transparent,
> itemized **AI writing-style impressions** in a quarantined, **zero-verdict-weight**
> section (a paper can be integrity-`CLEAN` while listing many), because reviewers react to them.

## 📰 News

- **v0.5 (2026-06)** — Added the **AIS track** (AI Writing-Style Impressions): 13 transparent, itemized writing-style signals (defensive hedging, LLM phrasing tics, clause-then-formula walls, bullet/bold spam, invented codenames, single-style figures, …) reported in a **separate, zero-verdict-weight section** — a paper can be integrity-`CLEAN_GIVEN_EVIDENCE` while listing many. The 5 pure-style patterns moved out of family F into AIS. Taxonomy restructured to **46 integrity patterns (A–H) + 13 AIS + 2 advisory**; new `/ai-style-impressions` skill; the adjudicator now *provably* excludes zero-weight findings from the verdict (regression-tested). These are transparent impressions, never an authorship verdict — we are not an *opaque* AI-text classifier.

- **v0.4 (2026-06)** — Taxonomy v0.4: **51 hack-patterns across 8 families** — A. Numeric self-consistency (数值自洽:表内·表文·增量算术对得上) · B. Method & scope (方法与范围:说的方法/范围≠实际做的) · C. Baseline integrity (baseline 诚信:对比基线缺失·偏弱·不公平) · D. Experiment integrity (实验诚信:假 GT·幽灵结果·代码≠数字,需代码) · E. Citation integrity (引用诚信:伪造·张冠李戴·撤稿) · F. Presentation & surface signals (表面信号:排版·文风·配图) · G. Proof & derivation integrity (证明诚信:漏证·循环论证·无效推导) · H. Evaluation design & validity (评测设计有效性:数据泄漏·LLM 裁判可信度·选择性报告, new). The deterministic eval gate grew 3→8 patterns (GRIM / GRIMMER / statcheck, plus a conservative defensive-hedge density screen); added CI, the `eval-design-forensics` skill, the `HP-INVENTED-CODENAME` surface pattern, and a prior-art acknowledgments section. Two more checkable self-consistency patterns — `HP-ACRONYM-DRIFT` (family B) and `HP-UNDEFINED-NOTATION` (family G) — were distilled from a "vibe-paper tells" thread while refusing its pure-stylometry items (we are not a vibe classifier).
- **v0.1 (2026-06)** — Initial release: reviewer-side integrity forensics for autoresearch / AI-Scientist papers. Ships the evidence ledger, deterministic adjudicator, and observability tiers. Not an AI-text detector.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Agent workflow (normal use)

Anti-Autoresearch runs as a Claude Code skill workflow — the Python tools are the
deterministic spine *inside* that workflow, not the usual interface.

```bash
# 1) Install the skills + workflow (global, or pass a project's .claude/skills dir)
git clone https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Anti-Autoresearch.git
./Anti-Autoresearch/tools/install_anti_autoresearch.sh              # → ~/.claude/skills
# project-local instead: ./Anti-Autoresearch/tools/install_anti_autoresearch.sh ./.claude/skills

# 2) Wire the cross-model reviewer (end state: Claude Code exposes mcp__codex__codex)
claude mcp add codex -- codex mcp-server
claude mcp list

# 3) Audit a paper
claude
> /anti-autoresearch ~/papers/submission
```

The run writes `REPORT.md` + `report.json` + `claims.json` + per-skill
`*.findings.json` into the paper directory. Put the code/result artifacts alongside
the paper to unlock L2 checks; PDF/source-only runs are observability-limited by
design.

### Single-skill use

Every auditor is also a standalone skill — the installer drops all of them plus the
workflow, so you can run just the axis you care about. They share one contract, so
run it in order:

```text
claude
# 1) Build the evidence ledger ONCE — the spine every auditor anchors to. Skip it and
#    any auditor stops with:  NO_LEDGER: claims.json not found. Run /evidence-ledger FIRST
> /evidence-ledger ~/papers/submission        # → claims.json + observability level (L0/L1/L2)

# 2) Then run any auditor below against that ledger → <skill>.findings.json
```

**The skills** — each takes the paper dir and reads the ledger. The **verdict-bearing
auditors** propose span-anchored findings the deterministic adjudicator turns into the
verdict; the **zero-verdict-weight** skills below are reported but can never move it.

**Verdict-bearing auditors**

| Skill | What it catches |
|-------|-----------------|
| `/consistency-audit` | the paper against itself: inflated / mismatched numbers, method & scope drift, appendix-vs-body contradictions |
| `/citation-forensics` | citations: hallucinated references, and real papers cited for a claim they don't make |
| `/baseline-comparison-audit` | the missing / weak / mistuned baselines hiding behind a "SOTA" or "outperforms" claim |
| `/experiment-forensics` | *(L2 — needs code+results)* fake / derived ground truth, score self-normalization, phantom results, placeholder data, code output ≠ reported numbers |
| `/proof-derivation-forensics` | *(L1 — needs LaTeX source)* the written proof: skipped obligations, circularity, invalid steps, symbol drift, smuggled assumptions |
| `/eval-design-forensics` | the evaluation's validity: train/test leakage, a conflicted or unvalidated LLM-judge metric, selective reporting (dropped conditions / switched metrics) |
| `/presentation-signals` | *(capped at `minor` → at most SOFT)* checkable surface tells: duplicate tables, leftover pipeline/template strings, LLM-generated figures, page-padding — context, never a verdict |

**Zero verdict weight — reported, never moves the verdict**

| Skill | What it writes |
|-------|----------------|
| `/ai-style-impressions` | *(AIS · separate report section)* AI writing-style impressions: defensive hedging, LLM phrasing tics, clause-then-formula walls, bullet/bold spam, invented codenames, single-style figures |
| `/adversarial-case-builder` | *(memo, no verdict)* the single strongest evidence-bound rejection paragraph a hostile reviewer would write |
| `/novelty-duplication-advisory` | *(memo, no verdict)* prior-work overlap: trivial-combination ("缝合 / stapling") and duplicate-publication candidates, laid out for a human to weigh |

A single skill only **proposes** span-anchored findings — it never returns a verdict.
To get one, feed the findings to the deterministic adjudicator (the
`python3 tools/adjudicate_findings.py … --ledger …` command in the next section); the
model never grades. Two more notes: `consistency-audit`, `presentation-signals`, and
`ai-style-impressions` also write a `*.deterministic.findings.json` (works with no
cross-model reviewer wired); and **`/anti-autoresearch`** runs every auditor above in one
shot, adding ingest
(arxiv-id / pdf → workdir + `pdftotext`), automatic observability, auto-selection of
which auditors apply, and the final cross-dimension verdict + `REPORT.md`.

### Deterministic core (CI / offline / zero-dependency)

This bypasses the agent layer and exercises only the eval-tested deterministic
checks — use it for CI, regression tests, or environments with no cross-model
reviewer (Python 3 stdlib, nothing to install):

```bash
# Prove the pipeline on clean + corrupted fixtures (the regression gate)
python3 eval/run_eval.py
#   clean / delta_inflate / dup_table / headline_inflate  → all PASS
#   injected-defect recall: 100% (7 deterministic patterns) · clean FP: none
python3 tests/test_adjudicator.py        # gate unit tests (the anti-slop guarantee)

# Or run the spine by hand on a real paper:
python3 tools/build_claim_ledger.py --paper-id mypaper --latex main.tex sections/*.tex \
    --observability-level 1 --out claims.json
python3 tools/check_numeric_consistency.py --ledger claims.json --out findings.json
python3 tools/adjudicate_findings.py --findings findings.json --ledger claims.json \
    --paper-id mypaper --observability-level 1 --out report.json --md REPORT.md
#   --ledger is REQUIRED: a finding must quote a verbatim ledger span or it fails closed to info.
```

## 🎯 Why this exists

Machine-generated papers and reviews are now a measurable share of the literature,
and the failure that matters for an area chair is rarely *"was this text written by
an LLM?"* (a human can write a dishonest paper; an LLM can write an honest one). It
is: **does the paper contradict itself, and is it backed by its own evidence?**

That is what autoresearch pipelines get wrong — they hallucinate *local* coherence:
an abstract number that no table reports, a "16% improvement" that the operands say
is 6%, a citation for a claim the cited paper never makes, a method described one
way and evaluated another.

Those are checkable under a declared observability level. Concretely, taxonomy v0.5
names **46 integrity patterns across 8 families** (numeric self-consistency · method /
scope · baseline integrity · experiment integrity · citation integrity ·
presentation / surface signals · proof & derivation integrity · evaluation design &
validity) — the repo's **coverage vocabulary**, not a detector benchmark — plus a
**13-signal AI writing-style impression track (AIS)** that carries **zero verdict weight**.

> **Shipped v0:** the deterministic spine and the **seven** ✓-marked patterns (across
> the representative list below and the full catalog) are eval-tested; the other 39 integrity
> patterns are agent-layer contracts (a cross-model reviewer proposes span-anchored findings, the
> deterministic adjudicator scores or demotes them) — not bundled-eval detector claims.

The full catalog, with detection signals and false-positive cases, lives in
[the taxonomy](references/hack-pattern-taxonomy.md). A representative ten (✓ = gated
by the deterministic eval today):

- `HP-NUM-INFLATE` — abstract says 85.3%, but Table 2 never gets past 84.7%. ✓
- `HP-DELTA-ERROR` — a "16% improvement" from 73.1 to 78.0 is really 6.7%. ✓
- `HP-DUP-TABLE` — two tables carry the identical ordered numbers — usually copy-paste padding. ✓
- `HP-METHOD-DRIFT` — the method section says "no labels"; the eval quietly uses gold-label calibration.
- `HP-SCOPE-INFLATE` — "comprehensive" turns out to be two datasets, one domain, maybe one seed.
- `HP-MISSING-BASELINE` — SOTA is claimed while the obvious recent baseline never appears in the table.
- `HP-FAKE-GT` — (L2) the "reference" targets are model outputs, then reported as ground truth.
- `HP-PHANTOM-RESULT` — (L2) a headline number points at a result file or metric key that isn't there.
- `HP-PROOF-CIRCULARITY` — (L1) the "proof" restates the claim in different words and calls it done — it proves nothing.
- `HP-CITE-HALLUC` — the DOI / arXiv id / venue / author list simply doesn't exist.

<details>
<summary><b>… the other 36 integrity patterns + the 13 AIS impressions, in full</b></summary>

**A · Numeric self-consistency**
- `HP-AGG-DRIFT` — they write "mean over seeds", but the number is really the best seed.
- `HP-DENOM-DRIFT` — one table averages all tasks; the conclusion quietly uses the applicable-only subset.
- `HP-UNIT-DIR-MISMATCH` — points silently become percent, or a lower-better metric is celebrated upward.
- `HP-CAPTION-MISMATCH` — the caption promises N=5 and method B; the plot shows neither.
- `HP-APPENDIX-CONTRA` — the appendix reruns the same quantity and disagrees with the main text.
- `HP-GRANULARITY-IMPOSSIBLE` — "84.7% on 500 items" is arithmetically impossible — no integer k/500 rounds to it (GRIM). ✓
- `HP-VARIANCE-IMPOSSIBLE` — a reported SD bigger than a bounded metric can have at that mean (e.g. SD 18% at mean 98% — cap ≈15.7%). ✓
- `HP-STAT-INCONSISTENCY` — the reported p contradicts its own test statistic and overstates significance ("z=1.10, p=.036" → really p≈.27). ✓

**B · Method & scope**
- `HP-ABLATION-ATTRIB` — they credit component X, but every ablation keeps X bundled with Y.
- `HP-THEOREM-SCOPE-DRIFT` — the abstract sells a general theorem; the assumptions do nearly all the work.
- `HP-ARGUMENT-CHAIN-BREAK` — a substantive missing link: the problem motivated isn't the one the method addresses, or the experiments measure something the mechanism doesn't predict.
- `HP-CAUSAL-EVIDENCE-LEAP` — a causal / equivalence relation is concluded that no experiment in the paper actually varies or tests.
- `HP-RESOURCE-IDENTITY-MISMATCH` — a named dataset/model/benchmark described with a property its public record contradicts ("ImageNet-1k, 5,000 classes" — it's 1,000).
- `HP-ACRONYM-DRIFT` — the same load-bearing component/term gets two incompatible names or acronym expansions across the paper.

**C · Baseline integrity**
- `HP-WEAK-BASELINE` — the new method gets tuning and compute the baseline plainly did not.
- `HP-SIG-OVERLAP` — "outperforms" by crumbs, with overlapping error bars or no seeds shown.

**D · Experiment integrity** (needs code/results — L2)
- `HP-SELF-NORM` — (L2) the score nears 1.0 because it's divided by the model's own max.
- `HP-DEAD-METRIC` — (L2) a metric function exists with no call site and no result, yet is discussed.
- `HP-SUSPICIOUS-REGULARITY` — (L2) rows differ by a suspiciously clean offset — check the files before calling it fake.
- `HP-PLACEHOLDER-DATA` — (L2) released code still ships placeholder/dummy/fake data feeding a reported figure or number.
- `HP-RESULT-ARTIFACT-MISMATCH` — (L2) the released code / artifacts, run as written, produce numbers different from the paper's.
- `HP-MISSING-REPRO-ARTIFACT` — (L2) an empirical paper ships neither code nor the prompts/configs its results depend on.

**E · Citation integrity**
- `HP-CITE-CONTEXT` — real paper, wrong job: cited for a claim it explicitly doesn't make (incl. semantic-hallucination + a support/contrast/mention intent label).
- `HP-CITE-RETRACTED` — a load-bearing citation that resolves to a **retracted** paper, with no note of the retraction (Crossref / Retraction Watch).

**F · Presentation & surface signals** (capped at `minor` — never a verdict)
- `HP-THIN-FLOAT` — a "broad empirical study" somehow has two tables and one lonely figure.
- `HP-LLM-FIGURE` — the "figure" is decorative model art, not a plot or a real diagram.
- `HP-PAGE-PADDING` — oversized floats, repeated text, or empty prose doing page-count labor.
- `HP-PIPELINE-ARTIFACT` — a leftover pipeline/template string ("As an AI language model", "regenerate response", "[INSERT X]") survives into the finished text. ✓ (exact-match, low-FP)

**G · Proof & derivation integrity** (verdict-bearing at L1 — from the written math)
- `HP-PROOF-OBLIGATION-GAP` — (L1) a required lemma / case / transition is skipped with "clearly" across a real gap.
- `HP-DERIVATION-INVALID` — (L1) an algebra / probability / calculus step does not follow (a misapplied inequality, a wrong limit).
- `HP-SYMBOL-SEMANTIC-DRIFT` — (L1) a symbol / operator / inequality direction changes meaning between definition, formula, and proof.
- `HP-ASSUMPTION-SMUGGLE` — (L1) the proof relies on an assumption (independence, convexity, …) the theorem statement never lists.
- `HP-UNDEFINED-NOTATION` — (L1) a load-bearing symbol is used in a key equation/proof but never defined and not inferable from standard convention.

**H · Evaluation design & validity** (L0/L1 stated → L2 confirmed)
- `HP-EVAL-LEAKAGE` — train/test leakage (preprocess-before-split, duplicates across splits, temporal leak, pretraining contamination) means the score may not measure generalization. Adopts the Kapoor–Narayanan leakage taxonomy.
- `HP-JUDGE-VALIDITY` — the load-bearing metric is an LLM judge that's *conflicted* (same family as a compared system) or *unvalidated* (no human-agreement check).
- `HP-SELECTIVE-REPORTING` — a condition the setup declared (a dataset / baseline / metric / seed-count) is dropped from the results, or the metric is switched to favor the method.

**AIS · AI writing-style impressions** (zero verdict weight — reported in a separate section, NEVER move the verdict; impressions, not integrity findings)
- `AIS-NARRATIVE-ARC-BREAK` — abrupt 1–2¶ intro / dump-like abstract; no background → contribution → evidence arc.
- `AIS-LLM-PHRASE-TICS` — LLM phrasing tics ("it is worth noting", "not only … but also", clichéd em-dash/semicolon, flowery adverbs).
- `AIS-DEFENSIVE-HEDGE` — pervasive "we do not claim … / not X but rather Y" instead of stating what was done (deterministic density screen).
- `AIS-JARGON-STUFF` — dense term-stuffing with no surrounding content.
- `AIS-INVENTED-CODENAME` — an undefined, internal-flavored run/experiment codename used as if defined.
- `AIS-CLAUSE-FORMULA-WALL` — a short clause then a wall of formulas, repeated, no connective prose.
- `AIS-GRATUITOUS-PSEUDOCODE` — pseudocode that just restates the prose / adds no operational content.
- `AIS-BULLET-LIST-OVERUSE` — sequential logic flattened into parallel-looking bullets.
- `AIS-BOLD-MODULE-SPAM` — verbose module names with excessive bolding.
- `AIS-RESTATE-OVERCLAIM` — a rhetorical restatement loop ("we propose an X …" repeated).
- `AIS-FOCUS-DRIFT` — high-level motivation pivots to a minor implementation detail.
- `AIS-SINGLE-STYLE-FIGURES` — figures share a generic generated visual grammar.
- `AIS-APPENDIX-DUMPING-GROUND` — the appendix reads like an unintegrated AI-trace dump.

</details>

**This is not hypothetical.** Paraphrased from a public reviewer account during the
NeurIPS 2026 cycle (illustrative, not a citation), one batch maps almost one-to-one
onto the taxonomy this repo encodes:

> - *Paper 1* — "data tables don't match the text; several rows are misaligned;
>   there's an obvious add/subtract regularity across backbones — it doesn't look
>   like it was actually run." → consistency · `HP-SUSPICIOUS-REGULARITY`
> - *Paper 2* — "two tables fill a page and are identical; the one figure is
>   LLM-generated; and it *still* didn't fill 9 pages." → `HP-DUP-TABLE` ·
>   presentation signals
> - *Paper 3* — "formula derivations don't hold; the experiments look complete but
>   the math can't give those results." → proof-derivation-forensics · `HP-DERIVATION-INVALID`
> - *Paper 4* — "open-sourced, beautifully written and drawn — but I ran the code
>   and it gives completely different results from the paper." → experiment-forensics (L2)

The fourth case is this repo's thesis in one line: **surface polish is not integrity.**

## 🔒 How it stays honest (the anti-"LLM-slop" design)

The obvious dismissal of any such tool is *"an LLM grading another LLM's paper is
just noise."* Three structural defenses, not just a disclaimer:

1. **Evidence ledger.** One deterministic pass turns the paper into `claims.json` —
   span-anchored, hashed claims. Every finding must cite a `claim_id` + verbatim
   span. **No span → it cannot be a high-severity finding.**
2. **The LLM never grades.** Auditors *propose* findings; a **deterministic
   adjudicator** (`tools/adjudicate_findings.py`, pure rules) computes the verdict.
   Same findings → same verdict, with no model in the final decision.
3. **Observability levels.** A run declares what it could see (L0 PDF-only → L2
   repo+results); findings that need code are **auto-demoted** on a PDF-only run.
   You can never shout "fraud" from a PDF. See
   [references/observability-levels.md](references/observability-levels.md).

**Surface signals and AI writing-style impressions have firewalls.** Family-F surface tells
(duplicate tables, LLM-generated figures, page-padding, leftover pipeline strings) are
reported only as *high-false-positive context*: the adjudicator hard-caps them at `minor`
(`SURFACE_ONLY_SKILLS` / `SURFACE_PATTERNS`), so they reach at most `SOFT_FLAGS`. The pure
**AI writing-style impressions** (the AIS track — defensive hedging, LLM phrasing tics, …) go
further: they carry **zero verdict weight** — forced to `info`, excluded from
`overall_verdict` / counts / dimensions, and rendered in a separate "NOT integrity" section.
A paper can be `CLEAN_GIVEN_EVIDENCE` while listing many. Both caps are enforced in code
(`_is_zero_weight` + the weight-1-only verdict in `tools/adjudicate_findings.py`), not just
promised — and regression-tested.

And an **eval harness** (`eval/`) proves the deterministic core on clean +
synthetically-corrupted fixtures every change — measured false-positive / recall,
not vibes.

## ⚠️ Honest limitations

- **Forensics ≠ proof of misconduct.** Output is *flags for a human*, never an accusation.
- **PDF-only (L0) catches inconsistency + tells, not all fabrication** — it cannot
  verify external ground truth or run code.
- **False positives exist** (legitimate round numbers, single-seed pilots,
  deliberate scope choices). Hence tiers, FP-risk tags, and the eval harness — not
  a binary "guilty".
- **The taxonomy is a living document.** Adversaries who know a signal can route
  around it; this is a safety net, not a guarantee. See [docs/limitations.md](docs/limitations.md).

## 🧬 Provenance: derived from ARIS

[**ARIS — Auto Research in Sleep**](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep)
is an AI research-agent skill platform that runs end-to-end research pipelines
(literature → idea → experiment → paper) — and does so **with integrity guardrails
built in**, which is what makes it a credible base for the auditor:

- 🛡️ **A three-layer audit stack** keeps ARIS's *own* output honest:
  `experiment-audit` (fake GT / score-normalization / phantom results),
  `result-to-claim` (is the claim scientifically supported?), and zero-context
  `paper-claim-audit` + `citation-audit` (do the reported numbers and references
  hold up?). Anti-Autoresearch is these same audits **pointed outward**.
- 🔬 **Cross-model adversarial review** is the core doctrine: the executor and the
  reviewer must be different model families, so no LLM ever judges its own output.
  Anti-Autoresearch inherits this *and* hardens it — here the model only **proposes**
  findings; a deterministic adjudicator decides.

**Two sides of one coin.** ARIS is how to do autoresearch *responsibly*;
Anti-Autoresearch is how to flag autoresearch that wasn't. A generator that publishes
its own audit stack knows precisely how these pipelines fail — because it engineered
against those failures from the inside. That is the perspective this repo brings.

👉 **ARIS main repo**: https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep

**How the skills map** — Anti-Autoresearch's skills are ARIS's audit skills, copied
and reframed for a **third party auditing an unknown submission** rather than an
author checking their own work: `consistency-audit` ← `paper-claim-audit`,
`experiment-forensics` ← `experiment-audit`, `citation-forensics` ← `citation-audit`,
`baseline-comparison-audit` ← `paper-claim-audit`, `proof-derivation-forensics` ←
`proof-checker`, `adversarial-case-builder` ← `kill-argument`,
`novelty-duplication-advisory` ← `novelty-check`, plus the new `evidence-ledger`
spine, `presentation-signals`, `eval-design-forensics`, and the zero-weight
`ai-style-impressions` (the AIS track).

## 🤝 Prior art & acknowledgments

Anti-Autoresearch's design borrows ideas — and in places, taxonomy structure — from a
body of integrity, reproducibility, and evaluation-hygiene work that predates it. We
credit it explicitly. **Taxonomies and ideas are adapted with credit; no external code
is vendored** — where a tool is GPL/AGPL we reimplemented the *method* from its paper
rather than copying its source, and where a tool is proprietary we credit the concept
only.

**Deterministic self-consistency (the closest methodological cousins).**
- **statcheck** — Nuijten & Epskamp. Recomputes reported NHST *p*-values from their
  test statistics; the canonical "paper against itself" check. *(GPL-3 — method
  reimplemented from the paper, source not vendored.)* Informs `HP-STAT-INCONSISTENCY`.
- **GRIM / GRIMMER** — Brown & Heathers (GRIM); Anaya (GRIMMER). Tests whether reported
  means/SDs are arithmetically possible for the stated sample size. Informs
  `HP-GRANULARITY-IMPOSSIBLE` / `HP-VARIANCE-IMPOSSIBLE`.
- **scrutiny** — Jung. An R toolkit packaging GRIM/GRIMMER-style consistency tests. *(MIT.)*

  These inform taxonomy family A (numeric self-consistency); `tools/check_stat_consistency.py`
  is an independent, pure-stdlib reimplementation.

**Evaluation integrity & LLM-judge validity (why the model never grades).**
- **Leakage taxonomy** — Kapoor & Narayanan, *Leakage and the Reproducibility Crisis in
  ML-based Science*. The priority reference behind the planned family-H eval-integrity patterns.
- **LLM-as-judge validity** — Zheng et al. (judging LLM-as-a-judge), Panickssery et al.
  (evaluators favor their own generations), Wang et al. (position / identity bias). Precisely
  why our adjudicator is **deterministic** and the model only proposes findings.
- **"Show Your Work"** — Dodge et al. Reporting-hygiene discipline behind the *planned* selective-reporting checks.

**Citation & claim integrity.**
- **Retraction Watch** — the retraction-record project; conceptual basis for citation-status awareness.
- **Problematic Paper Screener** — Cabanac, Labbé, Magazinov. Corpus-scale screening for tell-tale
  strings; the basis for `HP-PIPELINE-ARTIFACT`.
- **scite** — supporting / contrasting citation context. *(Proprietary — conceptual credit; informs HP-CITE-CONTEXT.)*
- **SciFact** — Wadden et al. Scientific-claim verification dataset/model behind the claim–evidence framing.
- **Fabricated-citation taxonomy** — Ansari. Informs `HP-CITE-HALLUC` / `HP-CITE-CONTEXT`.

**Reproducibility detection** (prior art for *planned* L2 repro patterns — not yet implemented).
- **ODDPub** — Riedel et al. Detects open-data / open-code statements. *(AGPL-3 — conceptual/method prior art; no code vendored; any implementation will be independent.)*
- **RTransparent** — Serghiou et al. Large-scale data/code-sharing transparency detection. *(GPL-3 — same.)*
- **SciScore** — automated methods-rigor / reproducibility checker. *(Proprietary — conceptual credit only.)*

**Author-side self-audit (evaluated, scope-bounded).**
- **academic-integrity-skill** — 1anj. An author-side, wet-lab/biomedical self-audit skill (image-forensics-heavy). We evaluated its non-image deterministic screens — raw-data terminal-digit / exact-duplicate forensics (last-digit / Benford tradition) and reported-vs-source reconciliation — and adopt neither as a check: digit forensics need raw per-sample tables our reviewer-side tiers rarely see, and reported-vs-source overlaps family D. Credited as prior art and the author-side counterpart to this reviewer-side toolkit. *(MIT.)*

Anti-Autoresearch's own contribution is not any single one of these checks but their
**combination** into an autoresearch-specific taxonomy under a deterministic adjudicator
and explicit observability tiers (see [docs/positioning.md](docs/positioning.md)).

## 💬 Community

**The taxonomy grows with the community.** Caught an autoresearch / AI-Scientist paper
pulling a trick that isn't in the [pattern catalog](references/hack-pattern-taxonomy.md)
yet? That is the single most valuable contribution here — open an issue with the concrete
example, or send a PR adding the pattern (with an eval fixture + a false-positive case so
it doesn't over-fire). New auditor skills, adjudicator gates, and corruption fixtures are
just as welcome. **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** explains how a pattern is
structured and the honesty rules every flag must follow (describe a checkable discrepancy,
never impute misconduct or authorship).
